          Dangy (or more accurately, Ddangy) is short for fatty in Korean...it also happens to be a personal nickname and 
          a perfect name for a Korean BBQ Restaurant!
        </p>
        <p>
          The interface I designed is intended to be a Korean BBQ restaurant's online ordering page. Because new customers often 
          like to browse various dishes, and returning customers like to quickly order their food, I wanted to make
          the interface visually appealing, simple, and efficient. Thus, I implemented filters for Course and Spiciness, a sorting
          feature for price, and an automatically updating order. By using Material UI, React, and JavaScript, I focused on making
          the interface aesthetic yet familiar.

          While creating the website, I considered various usability principles to make the website efficient, intuitive,
          and easy to remember how to use. For example, I considered how to display and auto-update the user's order on
          the same page to increase efficiency. I also created familiar cards for each food item, made the dropdown menus easily 
          visible at the top of the page, and incorportated various filters and sorts to make the interface easy to 
          learn and remember how to use. Finally, I looked to a mix of light and dark colors and focused on keeping enough spacing
          between various text and components to make the interface clear and easy to read.

          I learned that it is important to consider the interace's goal and purpose when designing how the user's interactions
          should progress.

        <li class="insight">
          Evaluating an interface's ability to make the user's experience simple
          and efficient is critical. For a list of items, incorporating filters and sorts are familiar features that increase
          efficiency.
